# Function_Plotter
I have created an app that can draw functions on a graph in Python

The Draw_Function.py file contains the interface of the app, which contains the grid with Ox and Oy axis and a couple of buttons with multiple uses

The functie.py file contains the interpretation of the function, transforming the string input into a binary tree, where the leaves are variables and constants, and the intermediary nodes are operators
